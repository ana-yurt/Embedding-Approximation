# Embedding-Approximation

I introduce an adapted embedding approximation technique that allows researchers to interpret how localized speech acts contribute to biases in global embedding spaces. I validate this method by using the approximation to predict shifts in yearly embedding spaces. The methodology provides a valuable tool for projecting the embedding space back onto individual sentences. This allows researchers to dissect the complex interplay between individual speech acts and aggregate meaning structures.

I would like to thank Professor James Evans for his support in purchasing and sharing the COHA dataset.
